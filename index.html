  <h1>Sowerby's Botany</h1>
  
  <p>
    James Sowerby (1757–1822) was a British naturalist and illustrator, known for his detailed and vivid illustrations of the natural world, particularly in the field of botany. His most famous work is the 36-volume "English Botany," a project that spanned nearly 25 years and included more than 2,000 hand-colored engravings of British plant species. His work remains a valuable resource for both scientists and historians.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sowerby’s botanical prints stand out for their scientific accuracy and artistic quality. He worked closely with prominent botanists of his time, such as Sir James Edward Smith, to ensure that the illustrations were not only beautiful but also informative. His contributions helped lay the groundwork for modern botanical illustration, and his prints are still sought after by collectors for their historic and artistic significance.
